Thank you for looking into translating OSM Scout Server. In Sailfish,
only harbour-osmscout-server.ts version is used and it should contain
all required strings. 

Some of the strings would contain macros in the form %macro%. These
macros mark the positions in the phrase that would be filled in with
corresponding data. For example, in string

Leave roundabout (%num% exit) into street %street%

keep %num% and %street% untranslated. These macros should be placed in
the sentence where they are expected to be replaced by the exit number
(%num%) and the street name %street%. 

For road types, as requested in routing speed table, you may find it
useful to see http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features#Highway
(link found by @eson57).
