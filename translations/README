Thank you for looking into translating OSM Scout Server. In Sailfish,
only harbour-osmscout-server.ts version is used and it should contain
all required strings. So, it is sufficient to translate only that
file. Strings in osmscout-server.ts are all in
harbour-osmscout-server.ts as well, so there is no need to make
osmscout-server.ts translation.

Some of the strings would contain macros in the form %macro%. These
macros mark the positions in the phrase that would be filled in with
corresponding data. For example, in string

Leave roundabout (%num% exit) into street %street%

keep %num% and %street% untranslated. These macros should be placed in
the sentence where they are expected to be replaced by the exit number
(%num%) and the street name %street%.
