Thank you for looking into translating OSM Scout Server. In Sailfish,
only harbour-osmscout-server.ts version is used and it should contain
all required strings.

To simplify translations, there is a project registered at
https://www.transifex.com/rinigus/osm-scout-server . Please use it for
working on translations.

Some of the strings would contain macros in the form %macro%. These
macros mark the positions in the phrase that would be filled in with
corresponding data. For example, in string

Leave roundabout (%num% exit) into street %street%

keep %num% and %street% untranslated. These macros should be placed in
the sentence where they are expected to be replaced by the exit number
(%num%) and the street name %street%. 

For road types, as requested in routing speed table, you may find it
