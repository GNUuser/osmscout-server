# OSM Scout Server

OSM Scout Server can be used as a drop-in replacement for online map
services providing map tiles, search, and routing. As a result, an
offline operation is possible if the device has a server and map
client programs installed and running. OSM Scout Server is mainly
developed for Sailfish OS, but could be used on a regular Linux
system.

Here, the user guide is provided with the description of setting up
the server and popular clients for offline operation on Sailfish OS
device. For developer's info, see GitHub page of the project.
