# OSM Scout Server

OSM Scout server can be used as a drop-in replacement for online map
services providing map tiles, search, and routing. As a result, an
offline operation is possible if the device has a server and map
client programs installed and running.

At present, the server can be used to provide:
* map tiles for other applications;
* search for locations and free text search;
* search for POIs next to a reference area;
* calculating routes between given sequence of points.

Server is a wrapper around libosmscout exposing its
functionality. This library can be used to render maps, search for
locations and POIs, and calculate routes. 

In addition to libosmscout, the server supports:
* search via geocoder-nlp (https://github.com/rinigus/geocoder-nlp) that is based on libpostal (https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal);
* map rendering via mapnik (https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik).

To use the server, you have to start it and configure the client to
access it. An example configurations for Poor Maps and modRana are
provided under "thirdparty" folder. At present, Poor Maps and modRana
include plugins already in the upstream and no additional
configuration is needed. 

The server is written using Qt. The server can be used as a console or
a Sailfish application. For console version, use
osmscout-server_console.pro as a project. For Sailfish, use
osmscout-server_silica.pro. 


## Maps

Starting from version 0.7, the server uses maps distributed via online
distribution network. It is expected that the users would download,
update, and, when needed, remove maps via server's GUI/CLI. This
distribution model allows users to specify which components are
required (libosmscout, geocoder-nlp, for example) and download only
the required components.

If tinkering is required, it is still possible to import the maps
manually. However, in this case, the user is expected to incorporate
the manually imported maps into configuration JSON file describing
that map and use specific developer options.


### Maps distribution and data

Maps are hosted by Natural Language Processing Centre
(https://nlp.fi.muni.cz/en/ , Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk
University, Brno, Czech Republic) through modRana (http://modrana.org)
data repository.

Map data from OpenStreetMap, Open Database License 1.0. Maps are
converted to a suitable format from downloaded extracts and/or using
polygons as provided by Geofabrik GmbH.


## Settings

Configuration settings are in
~/.config/osmscout-server/osmscout-server.conf and this file is
initialized on the first start. For Sailfish version, add prefix
harbour- to the file and directory name.

In configuration file you can specify server HTTP port and the
interface. In addition, map directory with several rendering options
are configured. In Sailfish, map rendering options are possible to
specify through GUI.

Starting from version 0.3.0, server supports up to 100
connections. The requests are processed in parallel, as much as
possible, with the number of parallel threads the same as the number
of CPUs. Depending on the used backend, one operation can block other
operations due to the blocking of the corresponding
database. Exceeding the number of supported connections would lead to
dropping the connections exceeding the limit.


## Default port

Default port is 8553 TCP and the server binds to 127.0.0.1 providing
services to local apps only.


## URL scheme

Access to functionality is provided via path and query parts of
URL. The path determines the module that is accessed with the query
specifying arguments. Here, order of query elements is not important.


## Examples

See `examples` folder for results of the example queries.


## Tiles

The server component for providing tiles operates using OSM convention
with small extensions. URL is

`http://localhost:8553/v1/tile?daylight={dlight}&shift={shift}&scale={scale}&z={z}&x={x}&y={y}`

where

`{dlight}` - either 0 for night or 1 for day

`{shift}` - allows to change used {z} by increasing it to {z}+{shift}

`{scale}` - size of a tile in pixels is {scale}*256

`{z}`, `{x}`, and `{y}` are as in http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames .

Addition of `{scale}` and `{shift}` allows to experiment with
different tile sizes to optimize for performance and human-map
interaction. Note that `shift` is ignored in Mapnik backend. See Poor
Maps settings for example.


## Location search

There are two versions of the location search query results. The only
difference is in returned JSON format with the second version, in
addition to returning the results, giving feedback on query parsing to
the user.

### Location search: version 1

The location search is accessed by the following URL:

`http://localhost:8553/v1/search?limit={limit}&search={query}`

where

`{limit}` - maximal number of search results

`{query}` - location and free text search

Results are returned in JSON format. Example query:
`http://localhost:8553/v1/search?limit=10&search=tartu mnt 1, tallinn`

```
[
{
"admin_region": "Tallinn, Kesklinna linnaosa, Tallinna linn, Harju maakond, Eesti",
"lat": 59.434895,
"lng": 24.758684,
"object_id": "Node 631817",
"title": "Tartu mnt 1, Tallinn",
"type": "address"
},
{
"admin_region": "Tallinn, Kesklinna linnaosa, Tallinna linn, Harju maakond, Eesti",
"lat": 59.404687,
"lng": 24.810360,
"object_id": "Way 9670330",
"title": "Tartu mnt, Tallinn",
"type": "highway_trunk"
},
...
]
```

### Location search: version 2

The location search is accessed by the following URL:

`http://localhost:8553/v2/search?limit={limit}&search={query}`

where meaning of the query parameters is the same as for the version
one. However, the result includes parsing feedback when geocoder-nlp
is used. For example,
`http://localhost:8553/v2/search?limit=3&search=tartu mnt 1, tallinn`:

```
{
    "parsed": {
        "city": "tallinn",
        "house_number": "1",
        "road": "tartu mnt"
    },
    "parsed_normalized": [
        {
            "city": "tallinn",
            "house_number": "1",
            "road": "tartu maantee"
        },
        {
            "h-0": "tallinn",
            "h-1": "tartu maantee 1"
        }
    ],
    "query": "tartu mnt 1, tallinn",
    "result": [
        {
            "admin_region": "1, Tartu mnt, Kesklinna linnaosa, Tallinna linn, Harju maakond, Eesti",
            "lat": 59.434894989690889,
            "levels_resolved": 3,
            "lng": 24.758684372594075,
            "object_id": 31299,
            "title": "1, Tartu mnt",
            "type": ""
        },
        {
            "admin_region": "13, Tartu mnt, Kesklinna linnaosa, Tallinna linn, Harju maakond, Eesti",
            "lat": 59.434417556482686,
            "levels_resolved": 3,
            "lng": 24.761235153386252,
            "object_id": 31312,
            "title": "13, Tartu mnt",
            "type": ""
        },
        {
            "admin_region": "14, Tartu mnt, Kesklinna linnaosa, Tallinna linn, Harju maakond, Eesti",
            "lat": 59.433896537377663,
            "levels_resolved": 3,
            "lng": 24.761358535001861,
            "object_id": 31314,
            "title": "14, Tartu mnt",
            "type": ""
        }
    ]
}
```


## List of available POI types

List of available POI types is available via 

`http://localhost:8553/v1/poi_types`


## POI search near a reference position

To find POIs within a given radius from a specified reference
position, server can be accessed via `/v1/guide` path:

`http://localhost:8553/v1/guide?radius={radius}&blimit={limit}&poitype={poitype}&search={search}&lng={lng}&lat={lat}`

where

`{limit}` - maximal number of search results

`{radius}` - distance from the reference in meters

`{poitype}` - POI type name substring (checked against POI type name in case-insensitive manner)

`{search}` - a query that is run to find a reference point, the first result is used

`{lng}`, `{lat}` - longitude and latidude, respectively.

As mentioned above, given POI type is considered as a substring that
is looked for in all available POI types without taking into account
the case of letters. For example, "Cafe" would match
amenity_cafe_building and amenity_cafe. However, "Caf√©" would miss
them.

The reference point can be given either as a query ("Paris") or as a
location coordinates. If the both forms are given in URL, location
coordinates are preferred.

The result is given in JSON format. It returns a JSON object with two
keys: `"origin"` (coordinates of the reference point used in the search)
and `"results"` (array with the POIs). See Poor Maps implementation on
how to process the results.


## Routing

The routing component allows to calculate routes between given
points. Server can be accessed via `/v1/route` path:

`http://localhost:8553/v1/route?radius={radius}&type={type}&gpx={gpx}&p[0][search]={search}&p[0][lng]={lng}&p[0][lat]={lat}& ... &p[n-1][search]={search}&p[n-1][lng]={lng}&p[n-1][lat]={lat}`

where each point along the route can be given either by `{search}` or
longitude and latitude with precise coordinates preferred if the both
approaches are used. The number of points `n` should be at least two,
with the counting starting from 0. The server looks for points in the
query by starting from index 0 and incrementing it by one until the
points with consecutive indexes are all found. Note that if you skip
an index in the list (like having indexes 0, 1, 3, and 4), the points
after the increment larger than one will be ignored (in the example,
points 3 and 4). 

The query parameters are:

`{type}` - type of the vehicle with `car`, `bicycle`, and `foot`
supported (`car` is default);

`{radius}` - distance from the points in meters where closest routing
point is searched for (1000 meters by default);

`{gpx}` - when 1 or larger integer, GPX trace of the route will be
given in the response of the server instead of JSON reply;

`{search}` - a query that is run to find a reference point, the first
result is used;

`{lng}`, `{lat}` - longitude and latidude, respectively.


For example, the following request finds the route between two cities
given by names:

`http://localhost:8553/v1/route?p[0][search]=Tallinn&p[1][search]=Tartu`


The result is given in JSON format. It returns a JSON object with
several keys: 

`locations` - coordinates of the reference points used in the calculations;

`language` - language of the maneuvers instructions;

`lat` - array of latitudes with the calculated route;

`lng` - array of longitudes with the calculated route;

`maneuvers` - array of objects describing maneuvers;

`summary` - object specifying length and duration of the route;

`units_distance` - units of distances used in route description (kilometers for now);

`units_time` - units of time used in route description (seconds for now).


See included example under Examples and Poor Maps implementation on
how to process the results.

At present, the car speeds on different roads are inserted in the
code. This will improve in future.
